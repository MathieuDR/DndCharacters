    Anise grows to height of about two feet and is distinguished by its unusual leaf formation. At its base, the leaves are heart shaped and toothed, but progressing up the stalk, they are small and feathery. 
    
    It has delicate white or yellow flowers which dry out in summer to produce small ridged seeds. These seeds should be crushed and left to stew for ten minutes in boiling water. The resultant mixture should then be strained and drunk as desired. 
    
    A successful application will relieve hiccups.
