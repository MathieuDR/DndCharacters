Session 7
Meeting up at the city, meeting a female (bronze) Dragonborn with the crest of the city (warden), plate armour, shield on back and spear, head was guarded with a helmet. Stopping all of us. Stopping nevrest, Meirah. "Don't know how you make all the evidence disappear, but i have my eyes on you and your friends" 

Walking towards the edge of the forest (which takes a day). beautiful day. 

A woman Tabaxi screams, we see 4 guys that are harassing the lady.
People ran away noticing us, woman is beaten and harassed

We're attacking the bandits, 2 slept, they didn't want to stop. 1 Of the corpses combusted.
No clue about the combustions besides some normal stuff

Bandit has a note describing the tabaxi.

They touch their wrist, a tattoo moves up their arm, I cut of his arm, at the head. snake tattoo bites the other guy in the neck.
Barely alive, screams very much. Cauterizes the wound.

I read about a fail-safe tattoo that criminal organizations use, so no info gets out. Person taps it, and destroy the body. So they can't tell secrets. organizations 'pythons' that is good at killing for information.

Tabaxi is happy about life being saved, doesn't know them. Wants to visit her father at Gravesford. He has shop inside the city. Hasn't heard from him. Tries to find him. Marcus Silverstein. Travelling trader.
Ingredients shop for herbalist. Pear Silverstein, Wintermoon.

Nevrest casts suggestion, to ask who he is working for: "Alsira".
Intimidates the bandit, saying he has more limbs to cut off.

It was a job, hired to stop her from getting to the city.

Had nightmarish dreams, Kreek looks pale, didn't sleep.

after the night, we find the path of Grabiel, find a house. Nice white picket fence. Full of flowers.
House made of stone

Meirah says it's a night hag, a magic user.

Red flower, toxic flower.

Get magical bolts on me, when I teleport away. We are able to run away from the night hag.
We didn't make friends with the hag.

Doesn't have an explanation for the need of the flower, or knows about the python/snake

Hands me a light book, with 3 spells: See invisibility, create water and protection of good and evil.

Can't write em in my book yet, as i don't have material

Dwarven brother is there. Hooded elf reveals herself as "Lady Maerwynn, baroness of ??" Know her as the ruler. Freedom and peace will need our help.

Leon bows. Baron got killed. Can't have an official investigation, but need our help.

Group of orcs invaded the castle, killing the whole family. No heir. Just the commander and chief Lord Saxton has temp rule over the country.

Never was a fan of the peace. And you can't really voice  it as it gets oppressed. No proof behind the possibility of coup. Leon and his company was sent away for training. From the baron.

Several people have been abducted, might be related. Can't sent army here. We could fight 'and have the skills'.

Nevrest has an 'itch' for people. Promises to help me get me in the academy.

We're unofficial agents, they have 5 platinum on her.

We enter the shop fo the trading traveller (Marcus Silverstyn, the father of wintermoon)
We smell iron & copper.

we found a corpse, with 5 stab wounds.
the warden comes in, and spot Nevrest and Meirah. I was able to hide.

We were able to convince her we weren't the criminals, they still wanted to question us. they also found the note how we got to the lady from Meirah.

We drink some no-no juice and we're being questioned. The paper of Wintermoon was with disappearing ink. The no-no juice is the special tea, to tell The truth. Thea Sicarias.

The teapot: very fine, well crafted 'can' with a floral design, Blue tea.

-----

Kreek (lvl 3 fighter) comes back with a nice leather armour made by Leon.

Nevrest doesn't want to go to HTS Pony.

Henry Morren, 
Thaâ€™dad Earthfinger
Stod Pairhoof

from HTS Ponies, but Henry is a 'thief' and a 'thug' according to Nevrest, that would have killed Nevrest sister and husband (Anton). Everyone but Clara perished in the fire, giving the Nevrest company to Henry. Thomas Nevrest confronted Henry, and he swum with sharks.

The fire happened some years ago.
