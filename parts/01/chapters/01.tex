    \DndDropCapLine{A}{n \Subclass{} \Class{}} \Race{}. Cold \& calculated from nature \Name{} still shows a lot of emotions for a \Race. Trying to release her master, \MasterFullName{}, who was cursed and turned into a spellbook.

    \section{\Race{}} 
    \Race{} are fey creatures following the lesser deity the Raven Queen and living in the Shadowfell. \Name{} hasn't lived long in the Shadowfell and has no memory of this time. It still slightly touched his personality to be somewhat more cold and calculated than most. Unlike most of his kin, she however has more emotions and do not take sick pleasure out of pain.

    \subsection{Emotions}
    As mentioned before, \Name{} is noticeably more cold than most people. she still feels joy, happiness and sadness just like any other non-influenced human or creature. You can notice that she still cares a lot, by her trying to release \Master{} and being upset that she she is a bit more pale.

    As \Name{} is not aware that she is a \Race{} and gets upset when people mistake her for anything else then a kind of elf. \Name{} is afraid of being a drow, and doesn't even know of the existence of \Race{}.
