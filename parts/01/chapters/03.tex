\chapter{Vararhak and Xion's cottage}
\label{shop}

\DndDropCapLine{P}{lants and potions is Vararhak and Xion's little (work)shop} they set up. 
A small but cozy cottage just fitting both of them with separate rooms. It seems a bit run down, but Xion and Vararhak are patching the place up. Mostly made out of stone and wood it has a very homily feeling to it. Because of the plants it has a very fresh, but acidic smell to it.

\section{Plants and Potions}
A stall with a tarpaulin roof covered with climbing plants and other vegetation is standing in front of the biggest open window of the cottage. 

The stall is full of jars of dried and fresh herbs, fungi and plants, besides these jars there are pots with life plants. Only a few potions are being displayed on the stall. 

\section{Inside the cottage}
The cottage is quite dim, but decorated overly with plants and other vegetation giving it a very fresh and pleasant smell. The alchemist workspace set up close to the big window does give a penetrating acidic tickle in your nose. Sporting a few separate workspaces, with alchemist and herbalist tools it seems well equipped for the novice craftsmen.

What is noticeable is that some furniture are quite small, while some are actually on the taller side. Besides the common furniture and workspaces there are also 2 doors leading to other rooms. One door, smaller then the other leads to Xion's room whilst the larger one homes Vararhak Root
